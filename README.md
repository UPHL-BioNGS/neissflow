# neissflow
neissflow is a Nextflow pipeline for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) isolate analysis. The mission of neissflow is to consolidate commonly used bioinformatics tools for Ng analysis into a parallel and scalable pipeline. Having all your tools in one place allows you to rapidly generate data and respond quickly to public health demands!  
  
neissflow is currently undergoing validation in accordance with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) quality metrics and Quality Manual for Microbiological Laboratories (QMML) standards; users are advised to interpret the results with caution until official validation is complete.

## Running neissflow from Nextflow Tower
neissflow has been tested on Nextflow Tower and will run as any other pipeline. This version of neissflow will need to be forked and modified, due to references being included within the repository. See [installation.md](./docs/installation.md) for further instructions

## Running neissflow from the terminal

1. **Example: run neissflow with test profile**  
    The test profile will run neissflow with a set of test samples, this can be used to check if neissflow is working correctly.
  
  - Log into your linux terminal 

  - Ensure you have followed the instructions in [installation.md](./docs/installation.md)

  - Execute neissflow as instructed below. (Using whatever profile is suited to your computing environment in place of all)

  ```
  $ nextflow run neissflow/main.nf -profile singularity,all,test --outdir <OUTDIR> --name <RUN NAME>
  ```
 
  In this example, just the test sample set will be run through neissflow, and it will procede through all of the steps. 

## Input Requirements

### FASTQ Nomenclature
To successfully run the pipeline, the FASTQ files need to be named appropriately, so that the pairs can be correctly identified. The acceptable file patterns can be found in the table below:  

  <center>  

  | Naming Pattern   | Example pairs |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | \*_{R1,R2}\*.  | <table> <tbody>  <tr>  <td>CA028_S1_L001<b>_R1</b>_001.fastq.gz, CA028_S1_L001<b>_R2</b>_001.fastq.gz </td>   </tr>  <tr>  <td>Test<b>_R1.</b>fastq.gz, Test<b>_R2.</b>fastq.gz </td>  </tbody>  </table>  | 
  | *_{1,2}. | CAJNED01<b>_1.</b>fastq.gz, CAJNED01<b>_2.</b>fastq.gz  |
  | *_{01,02}. | Test<b>_01.</b>fastq.gz, Test<b>_02.</b>fastq.gz | 

  </center>

### FASTQ Extensions
To successfully run the pipeline all FASTQ files must be gunzipped. Below is a list of acceptable file extensions.  

 <center>  

  | Extensions |
  | -------- |
  | .fastq.gz |
  | .fq.gz  | 

 </center> 

 ### FASTQ format
 Additionally, all FASTQ file content needs to follow accepted formatting for FASTQ files, this does not need to be checked ahead of time. However, if the pipeline does 	not run and the above conditions are met, this is the likely culprit. A descriptive error message can be found in the run log files if this is the case.

 ### FASTA Extensions
 Below is a list of acceptable file extensions for input FASTA assemblies.  
 <center>  

  | Extensions |
  | -------- |
  | .fasta |
  | .fa  | 

 </center> 

 If you choose to use contigs that have already been generated for the samples you are running through neissflow ensure that these have already passed through quality control steps as neissflow does not QC pre assembled contigs.

## Options
The majority of the neissflow components can be run a la carte depending on your analysis needs. Depending on which portions of the pipeline you would like to run, or skip, there is also the option to run with just FASTQ input, just FASTA contig input, or both. For more information on running neissflow, checkout [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md).

## QC Failure Conditions
There are two quality control (QC) checks performed in this pipeline, the first being a sequence check and the second being a species and assembly check.   

The conditions in the following table are used to pass/fail isolates after they are processed by fastp, such that only high quality FASTQ files are passed for further analysis:

 <center>  

  | Sequence QC Failure Conditions |
  | -------- |
  | Total reads before quality trimming & filtering < 352000  | 
  | Total reads after quality trimming and filtering < 88000  |
  | Total bases after quality trimming & filtering < 22418200 | 

 </center>  

 The conditions in the following table are used to pass/fail isolates based on their Mash identified species, mapping to the FA19 reference, and De novo assembly quality metrics, such that only high-quality Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates are passed for further analysis: 

  <center>  

  | Species and Assembly QC Failure Conditions |
  | -------- |
  | Mash top hit is not Neisseria gonorrhoeae AND the percent of FA19 with greater than 10x coverage < 85% | 
  | The percent of FA19 with greater than 10x coverage < 85% |
  | Bases in contigs > 2500000 |
  | Mean coverage < 11 |
  | Bases in large contigs (>10000bp) < 1850000 AND Bases in contigs < 2100000 |
  | Mean coverage < 15 AND Fraction of contigs that are large contigs < 0.25 | 
  | Fraction of contigs that are large contigs (>10000bp) < 0.1 |

 </center>  

## Major Subworkflow Architectures
### AMR Profiler   
The AMR Profiler Subworkflow performs AMR typing on the samples with reference to sensitive NG reference, FA19, as well as identifying the presence of resistance genes, performing allele calls, and sequence typing with various sequence typing schemes (MLST, NGSTAR, NGMAST).  
The following diagram illustrates what the workflow would look like when running the AMR Profiler (along with its necessary preprocessing steps upstream in neissflow). 
<center><img src="docs/images/amr_profiler.png" height=1046 width=779/></center>  

### Phylogeny
The Phylogeny Subworkflow performs core genome alignment, recombination detection, outbreak detection, and phylogenetic analysis on the samples in the set.  
The following diagram illustrates what the workflow would look like when running the Phylogeny steps (along with the necessary preprocessing steps upstream in neissflow).
